# The Problem
I love to cook, because it's a great skill to have, saves money, and is healthy. The problem is that I don't have a lot of time, so I can't cook what is seemingly most of the recipes I find online: Beautiful and delicious but overly complicated with many steps, lots of ingredients, and tons of dish washing afterwards.

# Best Platform
**Mobile, Web**

Displaying a recipe could really use the extra space, but it's much more convenient to have your phone in the kitchen to reference the instructions as you go vs. your entire computer. This is why I think this app can easily live across both platforms.
