# The Problem
I love to cook, because it's a great skill to have, saves money, and is healthy. The problem is that I don't have a lot of time, so I can't cook what is seemingly most of the recipes I find online: Beautiful and delicious but overly complicated with many steps, lots of ingredients, and tons of dish washing afterwards.

Right now, it is not easy to find low effort recipes; you need to go to a more generic platform, either an overall recipes app or something like YouTube, and do a heavily filtered search. Our goal here is classic "addition by subtraction"; we want to create a focused platform with *only* simple, low effort recipes.

# MVP Requirements
- Some sort of splash page with the logo, app name, maybe an explanation of the app, and a "Find Me A Recipe!" button

To make things simple

# Best Platform
**Mobile, Web**

Displaying a recipe could really use the extra space, but it's much more convenient to have your phone in the kitchen to reference the instructions as you go vs. your entire computer. This is why I think this app can easily live across both platforms.

# Difficulty
**Easy**

The v1 of this project is pretty simple as it's effectively a nice UI/UX wrapper around a single focused API call.

I haven't done a ton of research on recipe APIs, but it seems like finding a completely free one could be tricky. [Here's one](https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-recipe-api) that I found that gives 10,000 free API calls per month on the free tier, which should be enough to support a few thousand users. If you find yourself hitting the limit, congratulations, you have a great problem to have - Too many users!
