# The Problem
COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is high, and it's something the world has to solve in order to finally get past this horrible pandemic. I want a simple, clean, and **concrete** guide on how I can help by talking to vaccine-hesitant folks in my network and persuading them to take the vaccine in an empathetic, kind, and understanding way. There are a lot of articles on this already, but they're generally talking more about general principles and don't have hard tactics like exact phrases you can say. These articles are also part of a broader publication, which means they aren't focuses - They will have the cruft of the overall publication, links to other articles on the site, and probably ads as well. We want to make a focused tool just for this purpose.

# MVP Requirements
- The app should look good as it will initially be a fancy content store. Think elevated cards, rounded edges, transition animations between pages, and a focused color palette.
- Have a section going over the general principles (i.e. proper mindset) for navigating conversations with vaccine skeptics.
- Have a section going over the various reasons people have to be COVID-19 vaccine skeptics and how to best respond to each one. This is a big way we can make this app into more of a tactical resource; it's tricky just applying raw principles, most people need to know that if X happens, they should do Y.

# Best Platform
**Web**

This would actually be great on mobile, especially due to the "conversation simulation" extension mentioned below, but you aren't allowed to publish apps related to COVID-19 on the Google Play Store or Apple App Store unless you are an official medical/government entity. So we have to do this on web; the extra space is helpful for web though as this is a content-based app.

# Difficulty
**Easy**

This is almost purely a UI/UX problem; there is already a lot of great content on how to talk to vaccine skeptics as you can see from [this simple Google search](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=how+to+talk+to+COVID-19+vaccine+skeptics) I did. You just need to put the content together in a clean way.

At a high level, the idea is to make the MVP more of a content-based platform and then evolving it to be more interactive so the material is retained better (covered below).

# Possible Extensions
- Have examples of what to do and what not to do for each of the principles and strategies
- Have quizzes to test users' mastery of the content
- Have sample conversations of what a successful vaccine conversation looks like. You can probably find real examples of this online
- Build a conversation simulator where your app plays a vaccine skeptic that you have to convince. Websites can record and play audio nowadays, so this is actually feasible. In terms of UI, I'm imagining a chat-like interface with real-time transcription
  - In the beginning, you shouldn't grade the responses; just setting up the audio is hard enough. But if you want to turn this into a 1 million user app, you can figure out a way to grade the user's responses. Machine learning could probably help here?
