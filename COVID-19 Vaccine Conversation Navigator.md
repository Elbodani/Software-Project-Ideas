# Best Platform
**Web**

This would actually be great on mobile, especially due to the "conversation simulation" extension mentioned below, but you aren't allowed to publish apps related to COVID-19 on the Google Play Store or Apple App Store unless you are an official medical/government entity. So we have to do this on web; the extra space is helpful for web though as this is a content-based app.

# Difficulty
**Easy**

This is almost purely a UI/UX problem; there is already a lot of great content on how to talk to vaccine skeptics as you can see from [this simple Google search](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=how+to+talk+to+COVID-19+vaccine+skeptics) I did. You just need to put the content together in a clean way.

# Possible Extensions
- Open up some sort of MapView that the user can move around as the location picker, and it is defaulted to what the location services think is the user's current location so the user can just hit enter if they want.
- Create a widget that the user can have on their phone homescreen to make the location saving flow truly 1 tap (don't even need to open the app!)
- Make locations shareable
- Be able to add titles and descriptions to locations
- Bookmarking/favoriting
- Folders to categorize locations
- Data and analytics so users can see their most visited locations
