# The Problem
People keep posting in the wrong channels, because they don't realize other channels besides the default exist.

# MVP Requirements
- TBD

# Best Platform
**Slack**

This is specifically for Slack, so... yeah.

# Difficulty
**Easy**

I'm not sure how easy/possible it is to do a true move, but I can't imagine the "hacky" move being that hard.

# Possible Extensions
- Get the move closer to a "true move" if that turns out to be difficult
- Automatically add the user to the channel their message has been moved to
- Some sort of data tracking and analytics presentation, so users of the bot can see what's the most moved to channel and data like that
