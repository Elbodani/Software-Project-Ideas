# The Problem
I want to be able to figure save where I am as a location of interest, so I can quickly access it later.

I'm fairly confident that this is 10k+ users app, because I built a [very basic version of this app](https://github.com/Gear61/Location-Manager) myself on Android and it's gotten ~500 users with good reviews despite looking terrible. I literally just made a v1 and never touched it again.

# MVP Requirements
TBD

# Best Platform
**Mobile**

Location is very much a mobile thing as it's "on-the-go", so this really isn't feasible on web.

# Difficulty
**Easy**

Getting a base version of this is extremely easy as fetching the user's current location should have a million tutorials across iOS and Android. I have a bullet-proof location fetching flow that is built from scratch and doesn't use 3rd party libraries, which you can find [here](https://github.com/Gear61/Instafood).
