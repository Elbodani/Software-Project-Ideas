# The Problem
I want to know how safe it is to travel to a certain place from a COVID-19 perspective, and if it's not that safe there, what I should do to protect myself.

# Best Platform
**Web**

This would actually be great on mobile, especially as travel and location are very "on-the-go" type things, but you aren't allowed to publish apps related to COVID-19 on the Google Play Store or Apple App Store unless you are an official medical/government entity. So we have to do this on web; the extra space is helpful for web though as this is an information-display app.

# Difficulty
