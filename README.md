# Context
The absolute best way to learn as a software engineer is to actually build software. It is way easier than people think to deploy a legitimate, real-world tech product that gets 10,000+ users, all for free and "on the side" (i.e. you can do it outside your day job). I have done it [10+ times](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=9093438553713389916), and you can build side projects that people actually use too!

I created this repo, because product thinking is quite different from technical thinking. This is why most developers struggle to come up with salient product ideas on their own, especially junior developers coming from non-STEM backgrounds. Learning to code is hard enough already, so it is really hard to switch your brain to this more product manager mindset when it's also learning how to build any software in the first place. We have asked many times what people in the Tech Career Growth community, and the #1 response by a wide margin was coming up with a good idea. So here's a bunch of curated, high-quality side project ideas!

I deeply believe that all of these ideas meet the following criteria:
- Can hit 10k+ users with sufficient investment after 2-3 months
- Are buildable by any level of engineer, even the junior engineer who just learned to code over the past 3 months
- Are at least fairly original and not sufficiently solved (i.e. I did several Google searches and couldn't find something good)
